# rain-alert

The goal is the look at even more advanced ways of using APIs and looking at how we can authenticate ourselves with an API provider so that I can get access to more 
precious data. Also I'm going to be looking at how I can use an API like Twilio to send SMS messages to ourselves so that I can get an alert wherever I am.

All of this knowledge i sgoing to amount to is to build a rain alert application. So I'm going to be writing Python code that is going to send me a text message in the 
morning, just before I head out, telling me to bring an umbrella if it's going to rain in the day. So this way I don't have to check the weather. I know that my trusty 
application is always going to alert me via an SMS message if I need to bring an umbrella before I leave home.
